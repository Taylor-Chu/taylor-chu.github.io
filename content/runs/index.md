##### Why I run

I started running in the beginning of 2024 to lose weight and improve my cardiovascular health. I signed up to the Edinburgh Half Marathon race in August 2024 as a goal to work towards. Since then, I have been running regularly so that I can enjoy all the snacks I want without worrying about gaining weight.
